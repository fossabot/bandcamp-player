# Beta Player Remote Protocol Specification

This document specifies the WebSocket protocol used to remote control the Beta Player desktop application.

**Official Implementation**: The `mobile/` directory contains a helper React Native application that implements this protocol for Android.

## Connection

- **Protocol**: WebSocket (WS)
- **Default Port**: `9999` (Configurable via `REMOTE_PORT` environment variable)
- **URL**: `ws://<host-ip>:<port>`

> [!NOTE]
> The desktop app also serves a fully functional **Web Remote Interface** at `http://<host-ip>:<port>`.
> This web client provides:
>
> - **Playback Controls**: Play, Pause, Previous, Next, Shuffle, Repeat.
> - **Visual Feedback**: Real-time progress bar with seek capability and time display.
> - **Idle State**: Clear indication when no track is playing ("No Track" placeholder, disabled play button).
> - **Volume Control**: Slider with percentage display.
> - **Browsing**: Access to Collection, Playlists, and Radio stations.
> - **Search**: Filter Collection items by title or artist.

## Protocol Overview

- All messages are exchanged as JSON.
- Clients should handle reconnection logic (Exponential Backoff recommended).
- There is currently no authentication beyond being on the same local network.

### Hybrid Connectivity (Mobile App)

The mobile companion application implements a **Hybrid Connectivity** model to ensure seamless transition between Remote and Standalone modes:

1. **Persistent Connection**: The mobile app attempts to maintain its WebSocket connection to the desktop server even when it is in **Standalone Mode**.
2. **Background Sync**: While in Standalone mode, the mobile app continues to receive `state-changed` and `time-update` messages from the desktop. This ensures the Remote state is always current when the user switches modes.
3. **Instant Transition**: Because the connection is kept alive, switching from Standalone back to Remote mode happens instantly without requiring a new WebSocket handshake or discovery scan.

## Message Format

All messages are exchanged as JSON strings.

```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "payload": "any"
}
```

---

## Outbound Messages (Desktop -> Client)

These messages are broadcast to all connected clients when the state changes.

### `state-changed`

Sent whenever the player state changes (play/pause, volume, shuffle, etc.).

- **Payload**: [`PlayerState`](#playerstate)

### `track-changed`

Sent when a new track starts playing.

- **Payload**: [`Track`](#track) | `null`

### `time-update`

Sent periodically (approx. every 1000ms) while a track is playing.

- **Payload**:

  ```json
  { "currentTime": number, "duration": number }
  ```

### `collection-data`

Result of a `get-collection` request.

- **Payload**: [`Collection`](#collection)

### `radio-data`

Result of a `get-radio-stations` request.

- **Payload**: [`RadioStation[]`](#radiostation)

### `playlists-data`

Result of a `get-playlists` request.

- **Payload**: [`Playlist[]`](#playlist)

### `collection-state-changed`

Sent when the host's collection sorting or filtering state changes.

- **Payload**:

  ```json
  {
    "sortKey": "string",
    "sortDirection": "asc | desc",
    "filters": { "albums": "boolean", "tracks": "boolean", "wishlist": "boolean" }
  }
  ```

## Inbound Messages (Client -> Desktop)

Clients send these messages to control the player.

### Playback Controls

- `play`: Resumes or starts playback. No payload. (Client should prevent sending if queue is finished/empty).
- `pause`: Pauses playback. No payload.
- `next`: Skips to next track. No payload.
- `previous`: Goes to previous track or restarts current. No payload.

### Player Settings

- `seek`: Jumps to a specific time.
  - **Payload**: `number` (seconds)
- `set-volume`: Adjusts playback volume.
  - **Payload**: `number` (0 to 1)
    > Note: The desktop application maps this linear 0-1 value to a cubic volume curve for natural audio control.
- `toggle-shuffle`: Toggles shuffle mode on/off. No payload.
- `set-repeat`: Sets repeat mode.
  - **Payload**: `'off' | 'one' | 'all'`

### Data Requests

- `get-collection`: Requests the user's collection. Result comes via `collection-data`.
- **Payload**: `{ forceRefresh?: boolean, offset?: number, limit?: number, query?: string, sortKey?: string, sortDirection?: string, filters?: object }` (Optional)
    > [!NOTE]
    > `forceRefresh` defaults to `false`. If `true`, it triggers a fresh scrape from Bandcamp. If `false`, it returns cached data (much faster), filtering by `query` if provided.
    > The host uses the provided `sortKey`, `sortDirection`, and `filters` to return paginated results correctly sorted on the server.
- `get-radio-stations`: Requests available radio stations. Result comes via `radio-data`.
- `get-playlists`: Requests user playlists. Result comes via `playlists-data`.
- `set-collection-state`: Updates the host's collection sorting and filtering state.
  - **Payload**:
 
    ```json
    {
      "sortKey": "string",
      "sortDirection": "asc | desc",
      "filters": { "albums": "boolean", "tracks": "boolean", "wishlist": "boolean" }
    }
    ```

### Playback Initiation

- `play-album`: Loads and plays an entire album.
  - **Payload**: `string` (Album URL, e.g., from `CollectionItem.album.bandcampUrl` or `item_url`)
- `play-track`: Plays a specific track.
  - **Payload**: [`Track`](#track)
    > Note: If the Track object lacks a `streamUrl` (e.g. from the Collection view), the Desktop app will automatically attempt to resolve it using the `bandcampUrl` or `item_url`.
- `play-station`: Starts a radio station.
  - **Payload**: [`RadioStation`](#radiostation)
    > Note: Playing a station clears the current queue and adds the station as the only item.
- `play-playlist`: Plays a playlist.
  - **Payload**: `string` (Playlist ID)

### Queue Management

- `play-queue-index`: Plays a specific track in the queue by index.
  - **Payload**: `number` (0-based queue index)
- `remove-from-queue`: Removes a track from the queue.
  - **Payload**: `string` (QueueItem ID)
- `add-track-to-queue`: Adds a single track to the queue.
  - **Payload**: `{ track: Track, playNext?: boolean }`
- `add-album-to-queue`: Adds all tracks from an album to the queue.
  - **Payload**: `{ albumUrl: string, tracks?: Track[], playNext?: boolean }`
- `add-station-to-queue`: Adds a radio station to the queue.
  - **Payload**: `{ station: RadioStation, playNext?: boolean }`
