# Bandcamp Experimental Transport Assistant

The Unofficial multi-platform Bandcamp desktop player with mobile remote controller & standalone app

![Presentation of both desktop and mobile apps](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4d81bdb-f105-40d4-be8e-866e92477e50 "Beta Player (desktop and mobile apps)")

## Desktop App

AI-generated\* feature-rich Electron desktop application for playing Bandcamp music with fan account integration, offline caching, playlist management, native media controls, and many more!

\*not with one prompt, but hundreds of them (to be more precise, so far, over 101 conversations and 900 user prompts), a few weeks of designing, prompting, testing on different devices/virtual machines, re-designing, prompting, testing, etc., a full-time job. Still, not a traditional craft programming, and not as eco-friendly.

## Legal concerns

Since the application only allows users to stream and cache music they have already collected, I don't see any risk in using it. Below is Bandcamp's stance on much more questionable behaviors for comparison:
